* Common Build Errors
** Windows ERROR define
   Windows defines ERROR as something we cannot use.  Logger class used to use
   ERROR as an enum type, but kept getting overriden by the define and confused
   the compiler.  Solution was to replace ERROR with ERR.  Other possible
   solution would be to undefine ERROR, but that might cause other issues.

* Code Conventions
** Bracket Style
   I like to C style braces for functions, classes, conditionals and
   loops. Each brace is on its own line.
   #+BEGIN_SRC C++
     void function(void)
     {
        // Code
     }
   #+END_SRC

   Braces will always be used for conditionals and loops, even if they are
   followed by only one statement. Single line conditionals and loops are
   allowed.
   #+BEGIN_SRC C++
     if(condition) { statement; }

     if(condition)
     {
        statement();
     }
   #+END_SRC
* Design Plans
** Procedurally Generated Patterns
   * [ ] I want to procedurally generate different falling patterns.
   * [ ] I want to have multiple patterns on screen at once
